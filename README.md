# Simulating Dispersal Across Cost Surfaces

There has been a rapid increase is the application of resistance-based landscape models, such as those produced through Circuitscape (1), in the fields of animal movement ecology, landscape genetics/genomics, conservation biology and landscape ecology. Often these cost surfaces are parameterized through expert opinion or genetics but very rarely, animal location data. The goal of this repository is provide a tool to test scenarios of dispersal across a parameterized cost surface through simulation  and use animal location data to validate the parameterization of the cost surface values. 

The completed end product will be a Python library that can be imported and used by others with Jupyter notebooks detailing its use. Users will be able to upload their Circuitscape map and enter in the starting locations to run animal dispersal simulations.

This library is still in development, however Jupyter notebooks will detail the steps to begin exploring the cost surface layers and the notebooks will be actively updated.

To load your Circuitscape .asc file, please follow the 1_Upload_Filter_Circuitscape notebook.
