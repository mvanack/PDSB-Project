### VanAcker Code Review

**In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?**

Lucas - iGenome: The projects goals are very clear and the visual workflow is very helpful for conceptualizing the project goals. The installation instructions were clear and I was able to use pip install to install it on my computer. 

Jessica - Funguild: The goals of the project notebooks are well described. The broader context of the project is missing. There is information on the compatibility of the package with R versions which is nice but not much information on the usage. 

Chloe - public ridership and climate: The goals are very clearly stated in the README. The installation is clear although the directory within the github is not explained. It is very clear what each notebook can accomplish. 

I think the goals of the project are clear in my README file and the installation is very easy as it just uses Jupyter Notebooks which is described. After looking at Chloe's README I think I should have provided more detailed on what each of my notebooks can be used for. 

**Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?**

Lucas - iGenome: Yes there are python scripts in the project directory. I can understand the general structure of the class objects which call on different genome filtering softwares. However, the code is not very annotated so understanding the details of each line would require more time. 

Jessica - Funguild: No there are no python scripts and no mention of them in the README.

Chloe - public ridership and climate: No there are not python scripts, she did provide a note for where to find the code in the project file. 

**Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?**

Lucas - iGenome: There is no notebook in the notebooks directory but also no mention of it in the README file.

Jessica - Funguild: Yes, there are example notebooks in the notebook directory. The first notebook prepares data and visualizes the different OTU groups. And the second notebook prepares the data, creates a dissimiliarity matrix and runs an analysis of similarity. Although there are many steps to the analyses it is very clear what she is trying to solve in the code. 

Chloe - public ridership and climate: Yes, there are example notebooks. The example notebooks are well annotated and easy to understand. She did a good job pointing out what parts would have to be altered by the user. It seems the goal for the notebooks is more to visualize the data rather than analyze it. 


**Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?**

Yes, I think constructing a class object as Lucas did would lead to much less code that the user would have to work through, especially for running the dispersal and movement functions. After reviewing Jessica's clear headings I could add in more annotation of the sections of my code to help with organization for other users. And describing what can be done in my notebooks in a bit more detail in my README files would also be helpful.
